# odin-recipes

This project is to create a basic recipe website.
It demonstrates my ability to use html to design and link web-pages
that contain text, ordered and unordered lists, headings, and images. 
It also demonstrates my ability to organize those pages
so that they are all accessible from a single home-page.
